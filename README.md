### Project Overview

This AR application uses **A-Frame** and **AR.js** to create interactive experiences based on marker detection.

### Key Features

* **Information Panels (2 Markers):** Detecting the *Nike* or *Apple* marker independently displays a dedicated UI info panel with brand details (and changing original images).
* **Dynamic Bezier Curve (3 Markers):** When all three markers (m0, m1, m2) are visible at once, the app draws a **Quadratic Bezier curve** between them and animates an object along the path.
