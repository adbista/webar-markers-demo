### Project Overview

This AR application uses **A-Frame** and **AR.js** to create interactive experiences based on marker detection.

### Key Features

* **Information Panels (2 Markers):** Detecting the *Nike* or *Apple* marker independently displays a dedicated UI info panel with brand details (and changing original images).
* **Holographic Energy Triangle (3 Markers):** When all three markers (m0, m1, m2) are visible at once, a glowing triangular frame appears between them with orbiting sparkles and a pulsating ring that keeps the scene dynamic.
